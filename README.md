# Runout-sequence
add an extra runout sequence


Hello, I have recently had the problem that when the pre-gate sensors run out, the print head simply stops printing and then simply changes the role via the endless spool. Since no Prime Tower is approached in this case, the print is usually damaged at this point. Could you integrate your own runout sequence? Just to use a cleaning brush in this case? An activated pause followed by a resume would also be ok.
